# This hook will dump a mysql database automatically before every commit.
# To use this hook, change `db_name` and `db_dump` to the desired values, rename this script to
# `pre-commit`, and put it in the `.git/hooks` folder.

# If the command fails, it will prevent you from committing. To ignore the failure and commit
# anyway, run `git commit --no-verify`.

mysqldump -u root db_name -r db_dump.sql
