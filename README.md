# Scripts

A collection of useful scripts that I keep in my home directory. These mostly help me avoid looking
up the same commands over and over.

The install scripts in particular are handy when setting up a new system. No more going to
`rust-lang.org` to find the command to install rustup, just do `rustup-install`.

## Setup

Just clone this repo somewhere on your system:
```
git clone git@github.com:mfdorst/scripts ~/scripts
```
And add it to your path.

Bash/Zsh:
```
export PATH="$HOME/scripts:$PATH"
```
Fish:
```
fish_add_path $HOME/scripts
```
